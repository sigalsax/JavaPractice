# Java Practice

## Purpose:
To share different types of Java problems I have created for both fun and practice

## Files
MyQueue.java: queue implementation (enqueue and dequeue)
MyStack.java: stack implementation (push, pop, peek, minElement in O(1) time)
Occurances.java: counts the number of times a string is present in a string of n length. I have written the code for iterative and recursive cases.
