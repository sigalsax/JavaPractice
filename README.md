# Java Practice

## Purpose:
To share different types of Java problems I have created for both fun and practice

## Files
- [x] MyQueue.java queue implementation (enqueue and dequeue)
- [x] MyStack.java stack implementation (push, pop, peek, minElement in O(1) time)
- [x] Occurances.java counts the number of times a string is present in a string of n length. I have written the code for iterative and recursive cases.
- [x] Repeating.java returns the number in an Arraylist that is repeated
- [x] BinaryGap.java returns the counts of gaps in binary number 1001 --> 1 gap 1001001 --> 2 gaps
